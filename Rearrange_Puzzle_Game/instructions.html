        <p class="p">The purpose of the puzzle is to rearrange the initial
          configuration of the tiles to match another configuration known as the goal configuration.
           The rearrangement task is achieved by swapping the empty tile with some other tile in
           all possible directions (up, down, left, and right).</p>
      <h4 class="subtitle">History about the Puzzle.</h4>
        <p class="p">Sam Loyd (1841–1911), American chess player and puzzle maker,
           created the sliding tiles puzzle in the 1870s. The puzzle is represented
           by an m×n grid, where m is number of columns and n is number of rows, and
           each cell can be any imaginable value (number, letter, image, and so on.).</p>
